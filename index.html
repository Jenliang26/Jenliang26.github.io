    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
    Hello! First, thank you for taking the time to stop and visit my page! I want to warn that this is still a working progress, so more improvements and updates to come as I learn more! I am currently in a software engineering boot camp that would allow me to gain the skills needed to excel in an ever evolving technology dependent world. Hopefully, in another 10 weeks, I will be ready for this new to me career! When I am not in class learning about, Javascript, Python, and SQL, I enjoy volleyball at the beach with my team! It is all for fun but, I still enjoy a little friendly competition. I also appreciate a nice cup of coffee at my favorite coffee shop while getting lost in a book. My most important passion of all, is traveling around the world. I strongly believe that to truly live fully, we have to experience other cultures and admire the beauty we get to call our world.
